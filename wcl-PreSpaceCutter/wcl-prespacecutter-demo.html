    <h4>About WCL-PreSpaceCutter</h4>
    <p>PreSpaceCutter is simple plugin which makes coding pre-formatted text easier.</p>
    <p>When you are working on your html code and you have to write some pre-formatted text, it is a little bit problematic. In most cases you want to put your PRE text starting from left border of your container. If you want to archieve this you have to
        remove indentations from your code what obviously breaks code flow in your editor.</p>
    <p>PreSpaceCutter will help you to solve this problem.</p>

    <h4>How to add WCL-PreSpaceCutter to your project?</h4>
    <p>Plugin is just JavaScript file (wcl-prespacecutter.js) - put it somewhere in your project's directory and link it at the end of body of your document: <b>&lt;script src="wcl-prespacecutter.js"&gt; &lt;/script&gt;</b> - it will run automatically when
        your page is loaded.
    </p>

    <h4>How WCL-PreSpaceCutter works?</h4>
    <p>Basically WCL-PreSpaceCutter removes spaces from left side of your preformatted text but keeps line structure of this text. If the first or the last line of text is empty or spaces-only - it is also removed. That's all. What does it mean for you?
        You can write your pre-formatted text code according to your code indentations and plugin will remove unecessary spaces on-fly assuming that your leftmost line starts at the left border of the container.
    </p>

    <h4>Which elements are processed?</h4>
    <p>By default WCL-PreSpaceCutter processes CODE elements which are direct children of PRE elements ( <b>pre > code</b>) and all PRE elements. In most cases this is enough, but it's very easy to change this selection of elements beacause plugin starts
        with parameter which is simple jQuery selector. Take a look into source code of the plugin - it starts in first lines. If you want to change processed elements just change parameter in <b>wclPreSpaceCutterRun()</b> - according to jQuery selector
        rules. You can select elements with particular ID or class, but remember: this plugin checks type of element first - if element is CODE then plugin processes html code of this element, if element is not CODE then plugin processes all text nodes
        of the element.
    </p>

    <h4>Demo of this plugin:</h4>
    <p>Take a look at the source code and then compare it to what you see in your browser - that's how WCL-PreSpaceCutter works. Colors are just for easier observation.</p>


    <style>
        pre {
            background: lightblue;
        }
        
        code {
            color: red;
            background: lightgreen;
        }
    </style>



    <!-- DEMO STARTS HERE -->



    <pre> 
           this is first line of preformatted text
                 Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. 
              Sed pharetra elementum augue, rhoncus consectetur est vehicula eu.
        <code>
                    body {
                        background: red;
                        width: 100px;
                    }

                    div.important {
                        font-size: 3rem;
                        background: url('../images/nofuture.jpg');
                    }

                        div:not(.important) {
                            font-size: 2rem;
                            color: yellow;
                        }
        </code>
     And this is the second text node of PRE tag.
        Notice that every element and every node
          is processed separately.
      In this example we have three elements - two text nodes of PRE element and 
            one CODE element - and each one is aligned to left side of container, which is body
  </pre>
